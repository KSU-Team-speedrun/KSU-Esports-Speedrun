# KSU-Esports-Speedrun

The KSU Esports Minecraft Speedrun plugin transforms traditional, manually managed speedruns into an automated team-based competition event. Players are challenged to
complete a set of objectives within a set time limit â€“ promoting teamwork and strategic planning. Various modes are supported, such as weighted/unweighted speedruns,
team-based speedruns, and player free-for-all. Designed for flexibility, the plugin allows for customizable settings and support for future versions of Minecraft.
