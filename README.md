# KSU-Esports-Speedrun

The KSU Esports Minecraft Speedrun plugin transforms traditional, manually managed speedruns into an automated team-based competition event. Players are challenged to
complete a set of objectives within a set time limit â€“ promoting teamwork and strategic planning. Various modes are supported, such as weighted/unweighted speedruns,
team-based speedruns, and player free-for-all. Designed for flexibility, the plugin allows for customizable settings and support for future versions of Minecraft.

## How to Install:


This plugin currently works for Minecraft version 1.21.1 and the corresponding PaperMC server. A link to the correct PaperMC version can be found [here](https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.20.1/builds/196/downloads/paper-1.20.1-196.jar). 


For additional information on how to install and set up a Paper server, please follow the instructions here: https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started
Once your PaperMC server is setup, you can place the plugin .jar file in your server plugins folder. You can find the most recent Speedrun jar file on this GitHub in the following directory: [/build/libs/KSUMCSpeedrun-0.2.jar](https://github.com/KSU-Team-speedrun/KSU-Esports-Speedrun/tree/main/build/libs)


You can also clone the repository, make any changes you would like, and build it yourself.
Once you have downloaded the .jar and placed it in your plugins folder, start (or restart) your Minecraft server. The plugin should be successfully running at this point.


For information on how to use the plugin once it is installed, please view the [wiki](https://github.com/KSU-Team-speedrun/KSU-Esports-Speedrun/wiki).
